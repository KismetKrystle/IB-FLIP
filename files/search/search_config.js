The unfolding leaf is the beginning of a new perspective, \u000d\u000aand for a while, it is all it knows itself to be, taking in the \u000d\u000aweathering the seasons bring. Once the stem has endured the \u000d\u000achallenges and the bud blooms its flower, it waits to be seeded. \u000d\u000aYou are the flower, awareness is the seed, and evolution is the \u000d\u000ablooming reveal of the fruit that breeds your dreams.\u000d\u000a \u000d\u000aThis poetry collection is a chronicle of my revelations thus \u000d\u000afar, leading from societal dissonance to self-awareness and \u000d\u000amoving through self-doubt to arrive at confidence born from \u000d\u000athe recognition of eternal truths. Each chapter is assigned a \u000d\u000acolor that represents the overall essence of the selected poems. \u000d\u000aPoetry is about more than just words; it is about the feeling \u000d\u000afound in its tone, in the silence that structures its pace, and the \u000d\u000adictation of every syllable. So as you read, take your time with \u000d\u000athe poem\u2019s unique cadence and visual formatting. Each line is \u000d\u000aarranged to mimic layers of the poem when experienced during \u000d\u000aa live performance. \u000d\u000aThis leads me to the most immersive offering I have for you: an \u000d\u000aacapella recording of each poem. With this, the poems come to \u000d\u000alife as you read, as if we\u2019re sharing space in an intimate cafe where \u000d\u000aevery word carries the breath of its intention.\u000d\u000aIn addition, insights are woven throughout the book in hopes \u000d\u000athat when opened to a random page, the perfect one will find you. \u000d\u000aMay it encourage you to extend beyond your comfort zone, explore \u000d\u000abeyond what you have always known, and improve beyond the \u000d\u000adefaulted rate of conscious progression.\u000d\u000aEvolve with intention. \u000d\u000a*Scan the QR code next to the title of poem to hear the poems come to life as you read.*","8 | Infinite Bloom\u000d\u000aKismet Krystle\u000d\u000aINSIGHTS","Insights | 9\u000d\u000aKismet Krystle\u000d\u000aBefore knowing anyone cared about my words,\u000d\u000aI was fine.\u000d\u000aBefore I knew there was an audience to listen, \u000d\u000aI never wondered if my verbiage was right.\u000d\u000aBefore the accolades gave me external validation, \u000d\u000aI never measured the quality of my work.\u000d\u000aBefore being compared to another artist, \u000d\u000aI never scored myself, \u000d\u000aor worry about being copied.\u000d\u000aBefore accepting the title of a poet \u000d\u000aand being told the potential of my gift, \u000d\u000a I never questioned \u000d\u000a if I were worthy to become more than \u000d\u000a who I knew myself to be.\u000d\u000aBefore social media, \u000d\u000aI never wondered if I shared enough or too little.\u000d\u000aBefore all the terms of measure and labels of identity, \u000d\u000aI was enough without needing to mention \u000d\u000aI was anything other than being.\u000d\u000a 1","10 | Infinite Bloom\u000d\u000aATTENTION\u000d\u000aChapter 1","Attention | 11\u000d\u000aGeneration after generation, society after society, history \u000d\u000arepeats itself, and I\u2019m not convinced it has to.
